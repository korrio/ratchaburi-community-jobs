## 🔄 What We're Working On (IN PROGRESS)

Currently no active in-progress tasks. All major features completed.

---

## ⏳ What's Next (TODO)

### 🔴 High Priority
- [ ] **Create Provider Questionnaire for Job Completion**
  - Design post-completion survey for service providers
  - Integrate with job closure workflow
  - Collect service quality metrics

### 🟡 Medium Priority  
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
  - Test complete workflow from job acceptance to completion
  - Verify LINE bot integration works properly
  - Validate admin dashboard displays correct progress

---

## 🚧 Blockers & Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issues Fixed This Sprint
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: Missing job_progress fields causing API errors
   - **Solution**: Added ALTER TABLE commands and data migration
   - **Impact**: All progress tracking now functional

2. **Admin Dashboard Data Access Error**
   - **Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')`
   - **Solution**: Fixed data access pattern and field names
   - **Impact**: Admin can now view job progress properly

3. **Form Submission Type Error**
   - **Issue**: Rating field required when updating match status
   - **Solution**: Conditional field inclusion based on status
   - **Impact**: Status updates work without rating requirements

4. **Mermaid Flowchart Syntax Error**
   - **Issue**: Parse errors with Thai text in quotes
   - **Solution**: Removed quotes from Thai labels
   - **Impact**: All flowcharts render correctly

### 🚫 Current Blockers
- None identified
